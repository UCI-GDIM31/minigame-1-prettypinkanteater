## Devlog
I would describe the relationship between Scenes, GameObjects, and Components to another student by using the metaphor of a house. 
A scene is a house, GameObjects are the things inside of or that make up a house, and the supporting properties of these objects are components.
This is because a house is an all encompassing building for living and interacting that is made up of multiple parts in terms of furniture and construction
that decorate and define the areas inside for use, like doors or beds. Each of these individual things is then further made up of their own 
properties that support their function, like door handles or pillows.
